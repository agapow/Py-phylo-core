### IMPLEMENTATION ###

class Tree (object):
	"""
	An base class for phylogenetic trees.
	
	This class encapsulates both rooted and unrooted trees, so the two may be
	easily interconverted and compared. As a consequence, not all methods apply 
	for all instances (e.g. subtree traversal can only be used on rooted
	trees). This class can also serves as an interface or base to other, more
	specialised tree classes. 
	
	In-order iteration isn't provided, as it is meaningless outside strictly
	bifurcating trees.
	
	For example::
	
		# make the tree (A, (B, C))
		>>> t = Tree()
		>>> t.count_nodes()
		0
		>>> r, x = t.add_node (None, {'name': 'root'})
		>>> a, x = t.add_node (r, {'name': 'A'})
		>>> i, x = t.add_node (r, {'name': 'BC'})
		>>> b, x = t.add_node (i, {'name': 'B'})
		>>> c, x = t.add_node (i, {'name': 'C'})
		>>> t.count_nodes()
		5
		>>> t.count_branches()
		4
